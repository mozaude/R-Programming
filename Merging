Use the merge function to merge two data frames using common variables (column names) or row names
In the example below I merged two data frames using the common variable 'nid' that I had downloaded from MozART 

MainCohortUniqueVL<-merge(MainCohortUnique,ViralLoadLabResults,by="nid",all.x = T)

Code line explained:
MainCohortUniqueVL is the new data frame that will result from joining both data frames
<- this simbols assign that new data frame to the code that follows
merge is a fucntion built in the base R code to merge data frames
(MainCohortUnique,ViralLoadLabResults are the names of the two data frames to be joined
by="nid" is indicating that we want to merge by using the common variable nid
all.x = T keeps all variables in both datasets
